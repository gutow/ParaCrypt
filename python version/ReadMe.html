    <p>This software was originally a project started because I was curious to
      understand the weaknesses in the cryptography that privacy on the internet
      depends upon. Reading a little literature, poking through the cryptography
      standards documents and some cryptographic code convinced me that although
      most of the standard methods are reasonably secure at the moment, they are
      all vulnerable to increases in computing power and smart cryptanalysts. The
      only provably uncrackable encryption is a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">
      one-time-pad (see Wikipedia)<a>. One-time-pads are inconvenient to use
      because they require presharing a well randomized agreed upon key that is 
      longer than what is to be encrypted. 
    </p>
    <p>Paranoid Encrypt (aka. ParaCrypt) is my attempt to make this as convenient
       as possible. You still must preshare key files with your correspondent, but
       the files themselves do not have to be completely random. Your key files can
       be photos, large documents with a mixture of text and images or any other
       computer file you have handy (see below for caveats, it is possible to 
       choose bad key files). To make this work you must also share with your
       correspondent a password (even better, time varying passwords). The key file
       and the password are combined to make a one-time-pad with good randomness.
       As long as the password + key file combination is not reused or compromised
       the encrypted data should be undecipherable. That said, a good cryptanalyst
       with some idea of what is in your message may be able to extract some of it.

   <a class="anchor" name="installation"></a><h3>Installation</h3>
   <ol>
    <li><p>Install python and graphics libraries:</p>
    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Linux</div>
    <p>Required packages (install with system package manager): dpkg-dev, build-essential,
       python3.0-dev (or newer), libjpeg-dev, libtiff-dev, libsdl1.2-dev, 
       libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev, libnotify-dev, freeglut3, freeglut3-dev, 
       libsm-dev, libgtk-3-dev, libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev</p>
    
    <p>If available the following newer packages might work a bit better: 
       libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev, libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev, libsdl2-dev</p>

    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">MacOS</div>
    <p>Install a version of Python 3+ from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">
       www.python.org</a>.</p>
    
       <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Windows</div>
    <p>Install a version of Python 3+ from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">
       www.python.org</a>.</p>
       </li>
    <li>Install wxPython from PyPi. (eg. <span class="code" style="font-style:monospace">
       pip3 install wxpython</span>). Additional information is available in the wxPython documentation. Available
       at <a href="https://wxpython.org/" target="_blank">wxpython.org</a>.</li>

    <li>Put the folder for this software somewhere convenient.</li>
   </ol>
       
   <a class="anchor" name="usage"></a><h3>Usage</h3>
    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Command Line</div>
    <p>The program is written in Python and is compatible with Python3. It may run
       under Python2.7, but has not been tested. These instructions cover using
       the graphical user interface (GUI). However, encryption and decryption can be
       done entirely by calling python functions interactively. This is not covered
       in these instructions. You will have to read the code.
    </p>
    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Starting the GUI</div>
    <p>If the installation was done properly the GUI can be launched by 
       navigating to the directory containing this software and issuing the
       command: <span class="code" style="font-style:monospace">python3 wxParaCrypt.py </span>.
       If python3 is your system default you can just use "python" instead of
       "python3". The script "wxParaCrypt.py" also specifies what interpreter to use.
       Thus, if you set the executable bit in your OS, you should be able to launch
       the program directly. From the command line in *nix use something like:
       <span class="code" style="font-style:monospace">./wxParaCrypt.py </span>.
    </p>
    <p>It is also possible to create a launcher. This will depend upon which window
       manager you are using. In the lightweight Linux GUIs look for something like
       "MenuEditor" or a "Run Program..." option.
    </p>
    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Choosing a Key File</div>
    <p>It is important to choose a key file that introduces unpredictable randomness.
       <span style="font-weight:bold">Avoid </span>file types that have any of the following:
       <ol>
         <li>Repetative information (patterns).</li>
         <li>Large swaths of constant values (uncompressed cartoons or other simple
             graphics: .tiff, .gif, uncompressed .png).</li>
         <li>Very simple files such as plain text files.</li>
       </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Ideal files are files with unpredictable randomness that only you and your
       correspondent have. Some examples are:
       <ul>
         <li>Photos with complex backgrounds (preferrably natural) that have not 
             been posted to the internet/cloud.</li>
         <li>Document files with a mix of text and images (preferably photos) that
             use a compressed storage format (e.g. .odt, .docx, .zip, .gzip). Compressed
             files avoid long runs of constant values.
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Because of the way the password is used to randomize the key file, even key
       files that are not very random should provide reasonable encryption. Still
       it is best to use key files with as much unpredictability as possible. This
       software makes no effort to estimate the randomness of your key file. There
       are some utility functions that can be used to judge this in the codebase,
       but they are slow and designed to be used in interactive python.
    </p>
    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Choosing a Password</div>
    <p>Use the same rules you use for choosing a good account password. It should
       be at least 8 characters long (12 or more is better). It should contain a
       mixture of upper and lowercase letters, some numbers and symbols. <span
       style="font-weight:bold">Avoid </span> just slightly modified words or 
       phrases that can easily be guessed by someone who does a little research
       on you or your correspondent.

       or by typing the full path to the key file in the textbox provided.</li>

       <li>Type the password in the textbox provided. The password is not obscured; thus

       <li>Click on the "Decrypt" button and choose a location to save the 
       decrypted file. NOTE: The name for the file is stored in the encrypted
       data. <span style="font-weight:bold">If a file of the same name already
       exists in the location you choose, it will be overwritten!</span></li>
       <li>A popup window with status messages will appear. Read the messages to 
       make sure the decryption worked properly. You then may close this window.
       </li>
    </ol>
   <a class="anchor" name="algorithms"></a><h3>What the Code Does</h3>
   <p>The password is used as the initial seed for the Mersenne Twister psuedo-random
      number generator. The initial password also determines how many 
      random bytes are produced before the random number generator is reseeded. 
      The random bytes generated are xor'd with the key file. Some of these xor'd
      bytes are used to reseed the random number generator and determine the
      number of bytes produced before reseeding the random number generator again.
      All xor'd bytes are used to create a temporary randomized key file. This key
      file is reproducible given the password and key file because the psuedo-random
      number generator is deterministic (psuedo-random).
   </p>
   <p>If the key file is long enough a random chunk 1.5 times as long as the file to
      be encrypted is chosen from the temporary randomized key file. Each byte in
      the file to be encrypted is replaced with the address of a randomly chosen
      byte in the temporary key file that has the same value. This means that large
      files are significantly expanded as each byte must be represented by a multbyte
      address.
   </p>
   <p>Decryption is done by reversing the process. The encrypted file starts with 
      a small variable length header that contains encrypted information about 
      the encoding of the addresses in the temporary randomized key file.
   </p>
   <p>Notice that garbled parts of the encrypted file will not prevent non-garbled
      parts from being properly decrypted. However, damage to the header may make
      the file completely undecipherable. The files may also become undecipherable
      if the version of the Mersenne Twister used by the Python programming language
      changes.
   </p>
   <a class="anchor" name="usage_models"></a><h3>Thoughts on How to Use</h3>
   <p>Although I believe this code is secure, it has not undergone any professional
      security testing. Thus even the "High Security Usage" recommendations may not
      be secure. In general this should be used as another layer of encryption
      wrapped inside standard security such as https or PGP encrypted e-mail.
   </p>
   <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">High Security Usage</div>
   <p>Choose key files that meet the criteria in the section on choosing key files.
      Use strong passwords that vary in time. Preshare these with your correspondent
      as well. You should also agree on something to include in the encrypted file
      that will act as a signature so your correspondent can be sure it came from you.
      Store the key files on a removable device and do not attach this storage
      device to a network connected computer. Do all encryption on a computer or
      device that is not connected to the networks. Transfer only the encrypted
      file to the network connected computer to send to your correspondent.
      Decryption should be handled the same way. Do not resuse key file + password
      combinations.Transfer encrypted files using encrypted network protocols.
   </p>
   <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Medium Security Usage</div>
   <p>The restrictions for high security usage could be loosened a little. Rather
      then deciding ahead of time on which key file to use, the name of the key
      file for the next encrypted document could be transferred using PGP e-mail
      and a small key file that is reused with the time varying password.
   </p>
   <div class="sub-section"  style="font-style:italic">Low Security Usage</div>
   <p>Rather than using lots of private key files, share a small number of small
      key files and time varying passwords. Use these and PGP e-mail to agree on
      publicly available files as the key files. If your web traffic or your
      correspondent's web traffic is being monitored, decrypting your messages is
      reduced to guessing your password and combining that with the monitored
      downloaded files to decrypt your files.
   </p>
   <a class="anchor" name="caveats"></a><h3>Caveats (Warnings)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>This code should not be used for archival (long-term) encryption, because,
        as noted in the "What the Code Does" section, the encryption depends on
        the version of the random number generator used by Python. This may change.
    </li>
    <li>This code has not undergone a professional security review. Use at your
        own risk.
    </li>
    <li>If you choose weak passwords or key files that are not adequately random
        the encryption will not be very good. Any file with large swaths of repeated
        data will be very bad, because the encryption pattern will be
        determined only by the predictable psuedo-random number generator. Files
        with patterns (especially repeating) have similar problems.
    </li>
    <li>Reusing password + key file combinations will reduce the security of your
        encryption, because cryptanalysts may be able to figure out some repeats.
        That said, if your key files are larger than the files being encrypted you
        will be somewhat protected by the fact that random chunks of the randomized
        temporary key file are used each time encryption is done. Which chunk will
        depend on the cryptographic seed provided by your computer.
    </li>
    </ul>
