  Bugfix to randomize key to make sure that the central byte of the previous
  randomized chunk is used to pick the next chunk size. This makes the program
  incompatible with version 1.0.0RC1 and all previous versions. Modified About
  Box to use information from this Verison.xml file. Git repository cleanup.
