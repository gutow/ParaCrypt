Subject: Notice of publically available encryption source code classified under ECCN 5D002 

To whom it may concern:

I am distributing source code to create one-time-pads
for encryption of digital data. The code is distributed under the GPL V3 or
above open source license and will be available on sourceforge.net at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/paracrypt/. The site will become active by
March 30, 2018 or soon thereafter.

Questions can be addressed to me using the support request page.
https://sourceforge.net/p/paracrypt/support-requests/
Anonymous requests are accepted, but requests from a sourceforge account are
better tracked.

Regards,
Jonathan Gutow
